Muffin
======

Muffin is a UI skin for osu!, a PC rhythm game. The purpose of this skin is
**assisting gameplay** while maintaining the default look of the game i.e.
simpler cursor, no combobursts, etc. Elements which don't *require* changing
have been left as is, at least for now. It *doesn't look bad*, but it's not
meant to be specifically aesthetically pleasing. If default works fine, default
is used.

In other words, it places in the `xX__PRO420n0sc0p3__Xx` spectrum of osu!
skins. Or, it's like the default skin, but a bit more functional.

Muffin is for osu! and osu!mania, them being the modes I play.


## Features

 - small, bright red cursor
 - no combobursts
 - unobtrusive hit markers (invisible 300s, smaller 100s and 50s)
 - 'pop' hitsounds (clear but not loud)
 - customised followpoints (obvious where to next)
 - chartreuse combos (easy to see or something)
 - simple, non-animated sliders

There is no real, binding copyright on this work, because that would be silly
for a skin pack of mostly (and mostly transparent) images. Just be nice, and
attribute back if you remember.
