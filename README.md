Muffin
======

Muffin is a UI skin for osu!, a PC rhythm game. The purpose of this skin is
**assisting gameplay** while maintaining the default look of the game i.e.
simpler cursor, no combobursts, etc. Elements which don't *require* changing
have been left as is, at least for now. It *doesn't look bad*, but it's not
meant to be specifically aesthetically pleasing. If default works fine, default
is used.

In other words, it places in the `xX__PRO420n0sc0p3__Xx` spectrum of osu! skins.
Or, it's like the default skin, but a bit more functional.

Muffin is for osu! and osu!mania, them being the modes I play.


Features
--------

  * small, bright red cursor
  * no combobursts
  * unobtrusive hit markers (invisible 300s, smaller 100s and 50s)
  * 'pop' hitsounds (clear but not loud)
  * customised followpoints (obvious where to next)
  * chartreuse combos (easy to see or something)
  * simple, non-animated sliders

I used elements from other skins without asking permission from the creators.

give permission for anyone to use their assets, but unofficially I say *go for
it, just remember to give credit.*
