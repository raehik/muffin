Muffin
======

Muffin is a skin for the game osu!, named after myself The Muffin Man. The
purpose of this skin is **assisting gameplay** while maintaining the default
look of the game. That is, it includes a less intrusive cursor, no combobursts,
etc. Elements which don't require changing are left as is. It doesn't look
*bad*, but I haven't tried to make it look any nicer - if default is fine,
default is used.

In other words, it places in the 'pro' spectrum of skins for osu!. It's like the
default skin, but a bit more minimalistic.


## Features

 - small, bright red cursor
 - no combobursts
 - unobtrusive hit markers (invisible 300s, smaller 100s and 50s)
 - 'pop' hitsounds
 - customised followpoints
 - chartreuse combos
 - simple, non-animated sliders

I never actually asked myself. I give permission for anyone to use any of *my*

I have, and give credit to the original authors of any files you use. 

There is no real, binding copyright on this work, because that would be silly
for a skin pack of mostly (and mostly transparent) images. Just be nice, and
attribute back if you remember.
